      ⚠️  NOTICE: Role Responsibility Changed
      ==============================================
      MinIO-specific functionality has been moved to:
      - yamisskey.appliances.minio (MinIO deployment)
      - yamisskey.appliances.migrate_minio (MinIO migration)

      This role (apps) is now reserved for generic app management.

      For MinIO deployment, use:
      roles:
        - yamisskey.appliances.core
        - yamisskey.appliances.minio
      ==============================================

# Future: Generic Custom App management functionality can be added here
# For now, this role serves as a placeholder for non-MinIO app deployments
